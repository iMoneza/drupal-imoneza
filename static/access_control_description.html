<h2>Access Control</h2>
The access control method specifies how your site will communicate with iMoneza,
determine if a user has access to the resource they're trying to access, and display the paywall if needed.
<br />
<br />
<strong>None:</strong> No access control is enforced. Visitors to your site will not interact with iMoneza
and will never see a paywall. Essentially, iMoneza won't be used on your site.<br />

<strong>Client-side:</strong> The JavaScript Library is run in your users's web browsers. You can set whether
the paywall appears in a modal window or not on the Property Settings page.<br />

<strong>Server-side:</strong> User access is verified on your web server. This is more secure than the
client-side approach. If you choose this option, you can also exclude certain user agents (like search
engine bots) from being redirected to the paywall.
<br />
<br />
If you specify user agents to exclude, you can specify one user agent per line.
