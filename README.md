# iMoneza Standard Drupal Plugin

The iMoneza Standard plugin has two main features.  First, because not all content is created equal, you can easily indicate
premium content.  This lets your visitors know when they're in for a real treat.  Also, we've added the ability to
generate a message to your visitors who use adblock software.  If you're paying the bills with ads, you might want to
enable this feature and tell your visitors about your specific needs and why you have ads.

iMoneza provides a platform to accept micropayments for protected and premium content.  For more details or to get the PRO
version of this plugin (which contains these features plus the ability to manage your digital content and accept micropayments),
