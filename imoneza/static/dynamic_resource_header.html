<h3>Dynamic Resource Creation</h3>
Dynamic resource creation allows pages on your site to be added to iMoneza automatically
when users first hit them. To use this feature, make sure the checkbox below is unchecked
and that you've checked "Dynamically Create Resources" on the
<a href="https://manageui.imoneza.com/Property/Edit#tab_advanced">Property Settings</a> page.
